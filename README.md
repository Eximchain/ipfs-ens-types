# ipfs-ens-types

A private Eximchain package for managing the shared types across the IPFS-ENS Deployer system.  This includes:

- The core Deployment object we keep in DynamoDB
- Each of the API methods, following the same pattern from dappbot-types
- The GitHub types we make use of throughout the system
